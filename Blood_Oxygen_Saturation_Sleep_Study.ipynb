    "Sleep apnea events are typically measured by monitoring airflow. The number of apnea events per hour, referred to as a patient's apnea index, classifies the severity of the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). As an alternative, blood oxygen level can be used to infer these apnea events using a very similar oxygen desaturation index (ODI). An ODI doesn't appear to adbide by a standard definition, with one study defining it as $\\geq$4% reduction in SpO2 from baseline per hour (regardless of duration of reduced oxygen saturation (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6259496/). This study also recorded episodes of $\\geq3$% and $\\geq$2% SPO2 reductions. Another study defined it as a \"decrease in the mean oxygen saturation of â‰¥3% (over the last 120 seconds) that lasts for at least 10 seconds\" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8889990/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Translating these methods to our study, lets check for all of the above, especially considering my apnea is suspected to not be severe and we are mainly looking to establish a baseline for potential future remedies. One thing to keep in mind is the accurracy of the device relative to these SpO2 variations from baseline. I am using the Oxiline Pulse XS Pro (https://oxiline.shop/product/pulse-xs-pro/) which has recieved FDA 510(k) clearance meaning the reading are accurate to within 3% of actual arterial blood gas values for readings between 70% and 100% (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/pulse-oximeter-accuracy-and-limitations-fda-safety-communication). This 3% ($\\pm$1.5%) variability introduces considerable relative uncertainty in our results as we are looking at SpO2 reductions as low as 2%. However as mentioned we are collecting enough data to establish a baseline, the more data we collect the more clear any changes to our baseline will become should any solutions be implemented."
