# Blood Oxygen Saturation Sleep Study

Having struggled with quality sleep for the past few years, and having trouble getting definitive answers from single night tests prescribed by the health system, I am attempting to generate data over a long enough time period to look at trends. I am using a pulse oximiter to measure my blood oxygen saturation during sleep I hope to keep this up long enough to establish a baseline which can be used to compare data trends if/when a solution may be implemented.
